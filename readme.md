# WeatherApp

## The app uses the MVVM Architecture.

* Room - For offline data persistence & compile time query verification
* LiveData - Handle data in a lifecycle-aware fashion
* ViewModel - Manage your UI's data in a lifecycle-aware fashion

* DataBinding was buggy so I opted to do without it. However, future updates will include Data binding

## Major implementations based on Google I/O 2019
* Dark theme
* Gesture navigation
* NavController
* More Kotlin coroutines 1.3
